        <h2>Users primarily interact with the Google Assistant through natural voice, though keyboard input is also supported. In the same nature and manner as Google Now, the Assistant is able to search the Internet, schedule events and alarms, adjust hardware settings on the user's device, and show information from the user's Google account. Google has also announced that the Assistant will be able to identify objects and gather visual information through the device's camera, and support purchasing products and sending money, as well as identifying songs.</h2>

          <h2>I have really been into smart devices and turn my house into more of a smart home. I have gotten smart light switches, smart plugs, smart bulbs, Chromecast, and Google homes. I have sticked with the Google Assistant. I have tried their competitors like Alexa, but I’m very happy with the Google Assistant. I really enjoy turning lights on and off with my voice. There’s nothing worse than laying in bed, all comfy and forgetting to turn off the lights. With a smart light switch, I just say “Hey Google, turn off the lights”. I have a lamp in my room that has a smart bulb it in and works just the same. There are endless products that are now selling that say “Works with Google Assistant”. There is a camera, door locks, vacuums, fans, washer, Refrigerator, light strips, and a lot more.</h2>
