          <h2>Tesla is my favorite company for a while and I have been following them for a few years now. Tesla is so far ahead with battery technology, motor technology, and self-driving cars. Tesla is always pushing what is possible with cars and batteries. Teslas can what Netflix, Disney, Youtube, Twitch, and more all on the built-in screen (only in park). You also save so much money with an electric car. The average gas car costs $7.52 per 100km and an electric on average in BC is $2.41 per 100km. That is just their cars, Tesla also have solar panels that look like normal roof tiles coming soon. Their Powerwall that you used to power your with if that power goes out and can also be charged with normal solar panels. With a CEO and wild as Elon Musk, Iâ€™m sure Tesla has a very bright future.</h2>
