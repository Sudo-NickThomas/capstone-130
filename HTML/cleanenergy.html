        <h2>Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: electricity generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation, and rural (off-grid) energy services. Based on REN21's 2017 report, renewables contributed 19.3% to humans' global energy consumption.</h2>

          <h2>As I have gotten older, I started to reduce the amount of energy I use. If it’s a sunny warm day, I will hang my clothes on the clothesline or ill hang them on a hanging rack. I try to use natural sunlight instead of turning the lights on. I turn off the lights if I leave a room. I don’t leave the tv on if I’m not watching it. All these little energy savings will add up but the main thing with the drier. Without using the drier, the amount of energy used is a lot and in return, there is also a saving on your energy bill. It might not be a lot of money saved but it means that just a small amount of fossil fuel wasn’t burned. In BC we are lucky that about 90% of energy made is through returnable sources but it’s still nice to try to save energy.</h2>
