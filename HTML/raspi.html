        <h2>The Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries. The original model became far more popular than anticipated, selling outside its target market for uses such as robotics. It now is widely used even in research projects, such as for weather monitoring because of its low cost and portability.</h2>

          <h2>As I have gained more programming knowledge, I need something else to challenge myself such as a Raspberry Pi. This small device is an actual computer running Linux and can be used as a desktop or if you really want, a laptop. There a few different versions of the Pi. I recently got the Pi 3 b+ which has 4 USBs, Ethernet, Wifi, full-size HDMI, headphone jack, and Bluetooth. This picture on the left is an arcade running retro pi playing old games. The joysticks work as you would expect and can be run with 2 players. I am actually attempting to make this arcade soon. I have all the parts I need except for the wooding case. That will have to be custom made that I can design and cut out. Iâ€™m also wanting to add an HDMI port on the out to plug into a tv and the ability to connect PS4 controllers.</h2>
