        <h2>I, like most people, love nice things and what’s better than a nice home. I really love the modern house look with the angles and “box” look. As well as the dark or white colour. They are just so nice, not only to look at but as well in the interior. The interior most often ties in quite well with the overall look of the exterior. There is just something about a really nice modern house that makes you say “that’s a nice house”. </h2>
